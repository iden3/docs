# Identity

At iden3, our goal is to democratize identity. We believe that everyone should be empowered to become their own [certification authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority).

What do we mean by identity?

An identity can be a person, a company, an organization, a [DAO](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-dao-c7e84aa1bd69), a government. An identity can even be a thing: a chair, a room, a bot...

When we talk about identities we are referring to identities as accounts.

Generally speaking, these accounts are going to be smart contracts. So **you can think of identities as smart contracts**, where the address of the contract is the identifier of that identity.

Key takeaways:

- **Anything** can be an identity

- One person can define and have many identities

- In Ethereum, an identity is an **account** or a smart contract
