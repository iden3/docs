# Introduction

The first part of the tutorial walks you through the core components of Iden3 protocol necessary to initiate an identity and design claims:

- [Baby Jubjub Keypair](babyjubjub.md)
- [Sparse Merkle Tree](mt.md) 
- [Claim](claim/generic-claim.md)
- [Identity](identity/identity-structure.md)

Having understood the primitives you will be then able to start [**issuing claims**](./issue-claim-overview.md).

> The tutorial follows a cascade strucuture: each step relies on the data and code snippets generated in the previous ones. The full executable code can be found [here](https://github.com/0xPolygonID/tutorial-examples/tree/main/issuer-protocol)

## Iden3 Go Core Libraries 

- [Go Iden3 core](https://github.com/iden3/go-iden3-core) - Identity core primitives
- [Go Iden3 crypto](https://github.com/iden3/go-iden3-crypto) - Implementation of Poseidon hash and Baby JubJub Elliptic curve
- [Go Merkletree sql](https://github.com/iden3/go-merkletree-sql) - Implementation of Sparse Merkle tree
- [Go circuits](https://github.com/iden3/go-circuits) - A library for transforming the go-core primitives to json inputs for identity circuits

## Other useful resources  

- [Circom2](https://docs.circom.io/) - A compiler written in Rust for compiling circuits written in the Circom language
- [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) - An npm package that contains APIs to generate and validate zk proofs generated by Circom
- [GoLang Intro](https://go.dev/doc/) - Recommended if you are not proficient with GoLang
