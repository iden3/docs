Centralized Login Use Case
==========================

**Overview**

This document will guide you through the steps required to integrate
iden3's technology into your application's login.

Introduction
------------

Iden3 is a complete decentralized identity management solution that
allows users to leverage their pre-existing validated identities to
proof they are who they claim to be, saving them the hassle of having to
individually register with each service that requires a validated
identification. One of the direct applications of iden3's technology is
to allow web services to reuse these identities for login into their
portals.

The diagram below shows the steps taken by your back-end to enable
access to your application using iden3 identity system once the user
requests to login.

Iden3 provides the SDK to take care of requesting and verifying identity
so that the user can be authenticated.

Platforms supported
-------------------

**JavaScript**
:   <https://github.com/iden3/iden3js>

**Go**
:   <https://github.com/iden3/go-iden3>

Pre-requirements
----------------

Minimum requirements for a functional centralized login include:

1.  iden3 wallet service has been deployed
2.  User attempting to login has at least one valid identity.

Integration
-----------

A JavaScript reference implementation of how a third party can integrate
iden3's solution to login into their application can be found at
<https://github.com/iden3/centralized-login-demo>. In this example the
external service includes a front-end and a back-end server. We will
assume this front-end/back-end division during our integration overview.

<!-- Some examples on how the Go implementation is used can be found at
<https://github.com/iden3/go-iden3/blob/master/services/signedpacketsrv/signedpacket_test.go> -->

### Front-End

On the front-end side you will typically need to embed a button to start
the login process, and a place to display a QR code that the user can
scan to complete the authentication. After the button is pressed, the
front-end makes a request to the back-end to start the identity
authentication and waits for the response containing the QR code to be
displayed and scanned by the user.

In the provided reference implementation this is achieved by JavaScript
function *getLoginData()* found in frontend/index.js. This code shows
how to :

-   Send a request for a new *requestIdenAssert* packet to the
    centralized application back-end
-   Open a websocket between front-end and back-end
-   Display QR code containing the *requestIdenAssert* packet to be
    signed by iden3's wallet

### Back-End

#### Generating requests of identity assertion

On the back-end side you will need to prepare a new API endpoint to
handle the *requestIdenAssert()* petitions from the front-end. In the
reference implementation we use *GET/login* by calling JavaScript
function

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
const signatureRequest = iden3.protocols.login.newRequestIdenAssert(nonceDB, origin, timeout);
```

or Go function:

``` {.sourceCode .c}
requestIdenAssert := NewRequestIdenAssert(nonceDb, origin, timeout)
```

where

-   **nonceDB:** is a NonceDB object generated by calling an API
    function and stored in a RAM database
-   **origin:** domain of the emitter of the request, for example
    *'myweb.com'*
-   **timeout:** timeout in seconds, for example 2 minutes (*120*).

nonceDB is obtained by calling the following JavaScript function:

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
const nonceDB = new iden3.protocols.NonceDB();
```

or Go function:

``` {.sourceCode .c
nonceDb := core.NewNonceDb()}
```

Once you have the *signatureRequest* object, you can return it back to
the front-end so that it can be displayed.

#### Verifying signedPacket

On the back-end you will also need to prepare a new API endpoint to
handle the responses from iden3 wallet containing the *signedPacket*. In
the reference implementation we use *POST /login* to allow the walled to
send the signed data.

To perform the verification in the newly added endpoint you just need to
call *iden3js* library:

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
const verified = iden3.protocols.login.verifySignedPacket(nonceDB, origin, signedPacket);
```

or *go-iden3* library:

``` {.sourceCode .C}
verified, err := signedPacketVerifier.
    VerifySignedPacketIdenAssert(signedPacket, nonceDB, origin)
```

where

-   **nonceDB:** is the NonceDB object generated earlier.
-   **origin:** domain of the emitter of the request, for example
    *'myweb.com'*
-   **signedPacket:** signed packet sent by iden3's wallet.
-   **verified:** is *null* if verification fails.
